Azure Durable Functions simplify workflow orchestration in .NET environments. This session explores function chaining, fan-out/fan-in, async HTTP APIs, and more. Learn best practices, optimize serverless apps, and build efficient workflows without managing infrastructure. It is ideal for both seasoned and new developers.

## Abstract
In the dynamic world of cloud computing, serverless architecture is celebrated for its scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of management. Yet, orchestrating complex workflows in a serverless environment presents unique challenges. Enter Azure Durable Functions, a robust toolset that simplifies workflow orchestration within the Azure ecosystem.

This session focuses on the intricacies of Azure Durable Functions and their application in .NET environments. We will explore function chaining, fan-out/fan-in scenarios, async HTTP APIs, human interaction patterns, and more. We will demonstrate how Durable Functions can streamline the development of resilient, scalable, and event-driven workflows through practical examples and real-world use cases.

Attendees will learn best practices for implementing Durable Functions, gain insights into optimizing serverless applications, and discover how to leverage these tools to build efficient workflows without the overhead of managing infrastructure. Whether youâ€™re an experienced developer or new to serverless architecture, this session will equip you with the knowledge and skills to fully harness the power of Azure Durable Functions in your .NET projects.
