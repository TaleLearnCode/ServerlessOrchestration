## Abstract
In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing, serverless architecture stands out for its scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of management. However, orchestrating complex workflows in a serverless environment can pose significant challenges. Enter Azure Durable Functions, a powerful toolset designed to streamline workflow orchestration within the Azure ecosystem.

In this session, we dive deep into the world of Azure Durable Functions, focusing specifically on their application in .NET environments. From function chaining to fan-out/fan-in scenarios, async HTTP APIs to human interaction, and beyond, we explore the spectrum of application patterns that Durable Functions elegantly address.

Join us as we uncover how Azure Durable Functions empower developers to build resilient, scalable, and event-driven workflows without the burden of managing infrastructure. Through practical examples, best practices, and real-world use cases, attendees will gain valuable insights into leveraging Durable Functions to orchestrate seamless, efficient workflows in their serverless applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just beginning your journey into serverless architecture, this session equips you with the knowledge and tools to harness the full potential of Azure Durable Functions for your .NET projects.
